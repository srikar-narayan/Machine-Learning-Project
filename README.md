Predicting the Quality of White Wine

Dataset

Introduction:
Wine is a popular drink that has been around for thousands of years. Many factors influence the quality of wine including acidity, residual sugar, chlorides and pH level. By observing these characteristics we can predict qualities of certain white wines. One example would be how grapes grown in warmer regions produce “bolder and fruitier” wines due to the grapes ripening easier in these areas. This results in lower acidity levels and higher sugar levels in the grape itself (Gambetta). The dataset that we are using for this project is from Kaggle which calculates a quality score of Northern Portugal wine samples from 0-10 based on 11 properties. 

Problem Definition:
With its history, comes a group of wine tasters claiming that they can tell the best wines apart from the others. While they do have the experience, we hope to create a machine learning model that can help beginner wine tasters choose better wines over others – without the years of experience required.

Methods:
To quantify the white wine quality, a supervised learning model will be implemented. We intend to utilize a regression model due to its ability to assist in finding a relationship between all of the characteristic variables and thus their relationship to the wine quality. A random forest model will also be implemented due to its history of high-accuracy results. The third model to be implemented will be a neural network; they can establish thorough connections between the dataset and the determined results which may exceed the accuracy of the non-linear regression model. 4898 samples will be considered in the dataset, ensuring enough variety for accurate training and testing. 

Potential Results and Discussion:
	To analyze the potential results regarding the wine quality predictions, each of the developed models’ accuracies will be determined using a subset of the dataset designated for testing; through this comparison the model best-suited for wine prediction can be determined. With an accurate model, one may evaluate the quality of wine without the prior experience that is usually necessary. With an effective model, the white wine industry can implement the research to grade their products, eliminating the potential bias from human testing and expediting the testing process. For future applications, additional parameters for the wine can be examined to detect if more conditions affect the wine quality. Furthermore, red wines and more alcohol types can be considered for future developments.
